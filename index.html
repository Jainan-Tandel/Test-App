              For the person who nurtured the club when it was a small bundle of some curious students and established it as a close-knit community that has been growing larger as everyday passes, a
              simple ‘thank you’ will never be able to express our gratitude for all the things you have done for STAC. You have been there for us not just as a helpful senior or caring mentor but
              also as our true friend and well-wisher. We have learnt a lot from you and we know wherever you go, you will be genuinely happy whenever any of us will achieve something and will always
              be the person we can share our problems with. We look back to the day when you introduced this amazing club to us and cherish all the beautiful memories we have spent with you, be it the
              night outs, the fun telescope sessions, the exciting competitions, the canteen treats, the late night movies, the fun trips and parties and many more such memories that will always bring
              a smile on our faces. You are a gem of a person and will always be a source of motivation and inspiration for us. The club is indebted to you for your dedication and hard work forever
              and we look forward to the day we’ll meet again, talk our hearts out and laugh at all the lame jokes we can think of, not to forget your iconic dance moves! Wish you good luck in all
              your future endeavours, Shreyas. Keep making us proud with all your achievements!<br>Until we meet again! :)

              With a heavy heart , we are writing to bid a good bye to one of the best persons STAC could have. Surely, you are not going out of our family, you are just waving off from its eyes. STAC
              carries your soul, mind and dedication that you gave to this club, the way you cherished the club with those physics brainstorming sessions, when the &#39;Einstein of IIT Mandi&#39; used
              to teach us the lessons of relativity, the one who made physics phenomenally explorable. Looking back at all the interactions we had with you, it only fills our hearts with pleasure and
              happiness that we got a chance to be a part of the club that has amazing seniors like you. You will always be a person we all will look up to and be proud of. We admire you for your
              dedication, sweetness and humility. Your hard work and dedication is clearly reflected in the interesting STAC sessions that you have taken when you tirelessly explained us things in
              great detail so we could understand. We still remember the times when you would put all your thoughts on the board to make us relate with the different concepts of physics and astronomy
              and clarify all our doubts no matter how much time it would take. At the same time, we cannot deny the fact that you are utterly humorous in a very unique way which we love about you. We
              feel really sad that we could not give you the farewell you deserved but, we will miss you and always cherish the memories we have with you. We hope you had a great time at STAC, and
              will continue to be a part of the fam. Wishing you joy and happiness as you begin a new chapter in your life!

              Dear Shishir,<br>
              Yash here. Bansod, not Chaudhary :P<br>
              We first met in I guess the first meeting of Art Geeks for our batch. You were hands down one of the coolest seniors I had ever met. Hanging out with you and Nisha was some of the best
              moments of my life. I used to admire how you were a member of every club out there and how fun you had in them. Though I did not get much chance to hangout with you in STAC, I will
              absolutely miss the times I had with you in Art Geeks. I will miss the times we had laughs about silly things when we hung out in the Art Room. I will miss the mad trips we had to Ropar,
              Roorkee and Kheerganga. Trips with our gang are some of my fondest memories. I remember the time we all screwed up without you and Nisha in wall painting in Ropar. When we all walked
              aimlessly in the night to find a bus to mandi. Our tiring ride in the shitty bus, when we all packed ourselves on the last seat so as to avoid rocking ourselves sideways when we tried to
              sleep. Man... those were good days.<br>
              I hope we can stay in touch in the future. Shishir, mah man... I'll miss you •́ ‿ ,•̀

              I had a good conversation with you when our tech contingent went Roorkee for Inter-IIT. Though I have spent very less time with you; but I can surely tell you are one of the pure-hearted
              seniors. <br>
              Hanging out with you is absolute fun. Your Golden words "Memes are just manifestation of frustration" pops in my mind whenever I come across the same on the internet or feel low because
              of it.<br>
              You contributed to establishing a culture of technical blog writing in STAC. Your blog "In a Parallel Universe" was the first one to be posted on our medium, and now we have 8 blogs on
              our own blog site blog.stac-iitmandi.org.<br>
              It will continue to grow in the future! I wish I could have spent more time with awesome guys like you in college. I really admire you for your CTF and technical writing skills.
              Just stay in touch with us in the upcoming time!

              We were introduced to you right from your First year. Your engagement and your love for physics is very inspiring. We all appreciate you for the efforts that you have put in. You would
              come from the south campus to North even for a meeting of 30 minutes and that too late at night. We will always admire you for your humility and sweetness. Whenever we would meet you,
              you always greeted us with a warm smile that would leave an impact. To describe you I would say, you are our linking bridge between both the campuses and people whom we couldn't reach
              easily. You always had the sense of sharing knowledge with you. And we all got benefited by that as a community. With all those interactions that we had, we are honoured to have you as
              our senior. Thank you so much for sharing knowledge with us, spending time with us and giving us a golden opportunity to know how pure a soul you are. Just be the same as you are now!!!

              It feels like not too long ago when we were attending your sessions and exchanging cosmological ideas. We remember amazing night-outs with you, observing distant worlds through the
              telescope. We cherish post-event parties, enlightening conversations with you, and activities organized by you to intrigue us for astronomy. It's not just about the club. It feels like a
              family. We shall always be thankful for the things we learned from you. STAC saw a lot of growth and accomplishments under your mentorship. You established a legacy for us that we strive
              to grow. From the bottom of our hearts, we say GoodBye to you. We will miss you until we meet again!
